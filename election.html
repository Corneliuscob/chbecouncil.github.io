                        <p>We are running for Co-President of the CHBE Undergraduate Club, because we want to make the CHBE undergraduate experience awesome for all students in our department. This is a position of great responsibility, and we believe we have what it takes to make a meaningful contribution in this position. Both of us have been part of the CHBE Undergraduate Club this year and we have plenty of idea to make sure next year is an even better year for CHBE students.</p>

                        <p>"We are, and have been heavily involved in the organization and operation of the club for the past year. We know the workings of the club, and we are also aware of the areas in which we can improve. </p>

                        <p>Mike: I proved my organizational capabilities and leadership qualities as one of the principal organizers of the 3rd year field trip of 2015.</p>

                        <p>JP:  This year, I have shown leadership and initiative in my roles in the club and I believe I am a well-rounded person based on the wide variety of projects I participated in over the last months."</p>

                        <p>JP: My goal for 2016-2017 would be to enhance CHBE spirit and sense of belonging, provide more ways to help students get ready for the world after graduation and increase CHBE undergraduate exposure to the industry.</p>

                        <p>We are interested in this 
                            position because we would like to continue to be a part of the CHBE executive council in the 2016/2017 school year. This year we had an amazing time as second year co-reps, as well as having learned a lot from working together, which has given us the experience to be a successful co-VP team. We are both highly organized and friendly individuals, and we love being active members in the CHBE Undergrad community, so running as a VP team would be a perfect fit for us.</p>

                            continue some of the projects that the CHBE Undergraduate club has started/taken on, such as redesigning the club room, refurbishing CHBE merchandise, and in general, continuing to work with all of the undergrad students to build up the CHBE community through various events and activities. </p>

                        <p>As it is my last year in CHBE,
                            I'd like to get more involved in the activities of the council. The secretarial role also seems like a good way to support the different council activities, as I can sort of be like an all-around assistant to the council activities! I am a good fit for the position because I am very organized, can manage my time well and have great communication skills. These skills are contributing factors to my reliable work ethic, which usually results in getting things done. I also have a tendency to go above and beyond my duties, which can help the team become super aCHiBErs (achievers)!</p>

                        <p>I hope to accomplish secretarial 
                            duties by taking concise and accurate meeting minutes, keeping the CHBE website up to date (if that is a secretarial role), keeping CHBE students aware of engineering and CHBE related events by getting the word out through the website or other media, aid in any promotional poster making for events, organize elections, and get involved in planning other CHBE activities as part of the council (like creating more outreach related events). Overall, I would like to do my responsibilities well and help council events run smoothly. </p>

                        <h5>Why am you a good fit?</h5>
                        <p>We love CHBE and we've got 
                            a lot of CHBE spirit to share! As fourth year reps we want to make our last year great for us and all our fellow fourth years. This includes making our last academic year go by smoothly and as stress free as possible by listening to the student body and working closely with the academic reps; creating a magnificent grad package by getting everyone an iron ring and some snazzy grad photos they'll be proud to take home to the parents as well as some slipstick memories we can keep to ourselves; and of course some grad ragers. As publicity officers this past year, we got to learn about the structure of CHBE council and spend some time with the current fourth year reps, giving us the chance to see all the responsibilities and work involved with the position and we are well equipped to represent fourth year!</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h5>What do you expect to accomplish</h5>
                        <p>Our main focus is to represent 
                            the fourth years and ensure their voices are heard. It's our last year and we shouldn't have to fret about formals and midterms falling in the same week or back to back midterms during E-week. We would also like to facilitate an easy transition to convocation, including iron ring sizing and grad photos. Being the creative publicity officers we are, we would love to create a fantastic CHBE spread for the slipstick. And last but not least we want to get the fourth years to remember their last year at UBC as one of the best! Grad dinners and parties, and if we can raise enough funds even a grad trip! </p>

                        <p>I am interested in the position of Third Year Representative simply because I care about the success and well being of my peers. I enjoy helping others and volunteering my time to help improve the undergraduate experience of this department. 

                            My experience in the CHBE Undergraduate Club began as the Second Year Representative last year. Since entering CHBE, I have been involved with various CHBE sport teams, E-Week, and socials. I believe that in order to earn the honour of Third Year Representative, one must be personable and be able to provide an accurate collective voice for the all of the students in third year. Having built strong relationships with students over the past two years, I am confident that I will be able to have your concerns and opinions heard by the council and the department. </p>

                        <h5>What do you expect to accomplish</h5>
                        <p>My goals for next year if I am elected are to
                            improve the academic support for the second year students, to improve the camaraderie and spirit within CHBE, and to organize the third year field trip. During the second term of my second year, we had CHBE 230 tutorial before the first quiz that was very successful with students. I want to expand on that idea to hosting more peer lead tutorials, and perhaps even develop a peer tutoring program in the department. Secondly I want to help increase the turnout of students during E-Week and at our socials by getting people more excited about our events. Lastly, I will ensure that the third year field gets organized properly and keep an active line of communication with students about any updates.</p>

                        <p>I am interested in the position 
                            because I want to get more involved with the CHBE undergraduate club after attending many of the events hosted by the club this year. I think it's a great opportunity to enrich my undergraduate experience and also to give back. After being in CHBE for a year, I think being a part of the council is a really good way to immerse myself in the CHBE community and to connect with a lot of talented and dedicated people that I would not normally get the chance to connect with.</p>

It is my goal to find at least one more example of biological industry to visit during the trip. Additionally, I want to accurately represent the views and opinions of the 3rd Year students in CHBE, as well as be able to bring to attention any potential issues that may arise throughout the year. </p>

In the event of that scenario I would still want to be a part of the CHBE Undergraduate Council and participate as much as I am able, However, I understand if I must step down in favor of a candidate that is currently in classes.</p>

                        <h5>Why are you a good fit?</h5>
                        <p>We have both had the amazing opportunity to participate in the chemical & biological engineering undergraduate club  (Sheida as the publicity officer and Pranav as the Vice President). Thus, we believe that we both have had some experience with the positions, objectives and the curriculum. Furthermore, both being international students, we have had a great exposure to various academic resources at UBC and have developed excellent communication skills to interact with instructors and students. Most importantly, we are enthusiastic to create positive changes and be committed to more than student responsibilities. Finally, since Pranav and I, have had many chances to work in groups, we have developed very effective and flexible team-working skills.

                        This position not only would benefit our colleague students, but also will provide a valuable learning experience for us. As third year is anticipated to be a very challenging academic year, we are going to strive to assist the students to easier focus on their learning objectives and experience a smoother, more organised academic year. This is going to be achieved through devising a constant instructor-student feedback loop as well scheduling the exams, important assignments and events in advance and in a conflict-free manner. Additionally, this position will be a great opportunity for us as it enables us to get more involved in the academic curriculum and further strengthen our interactions with the associated professors and academic authorities.</p>

                        <p>As academic coordinators we both wish to give platform to CHBE  students to raise their concerns with faculty members. Our plan is to work together and pursue the following responsibilities and duties:
<br>
1. Collaborate with faculty members to conduct various tutorials and workshops for CHBE students.<br>
2. Develop and manage comprehensive academic support program <br>
3. Conduct more interactive sessions like beef & pizza to allow CHBE students to discuss academic related issues.<br>
4. Develop program for second year students to allow smooth transition from first year <br>
5. Promote group studies in CHBE by organizing events involving students from each year.<br>
6. To hold special tutorials for students before exam<br>
7. To develop a platform for students and professors to raise general conerns anonymously <br>
8. Organize programs for stress management during exams <br>
9. Ensure frequent surveys for students to enable them to raise concerns <br>

                        <p>JP: My goal for 2016-2017 would be to enhance CHBE spirit and sense of belonging, provide more ways to help students get ready for the world after graduation and increase CHBE undergraduate exposure to the industry.</p>       -->

                        <p>Marc:<br> 1. I have had a lot of multifaceted roles that have allowed me to attain different contacts; much so that co-op office offered me a position! I can use this position to get in contact with lots of cool people for our events.<br>
                            2. I have managed to accumulate a wide source of contacts I can tap into within and outside of UBC. Namely from past jobs, acquaintances, past networking events.<br>
                            3. I am a president candidate of EWB next year, and will probably be able to use the contacts there for this position.<br>
                            4. I am in the Biological Option, the reason why I wouldn't mind co-running with someone in the Process Option is to diversify interests. Someone may know oil companies better than I do (highly likely).<br>

                        <h5>What do you expect to accomplish?</h5>
                        <p>Realistic:<br>
                        1. At least 2 (one in each term) successful industry mixers and panels.<br>
                            2. Collaboration with EUS, APSC, and UBC mixers.<br>
                            Optimistic:<br>
                        1. Cool swag for CHBE.<br>
                        2. Cool jobs for CHBE.<br>
                        3. Charity event-type mixer. Some students have a hard time finding good things to talk about. Maybe this is a good icebreaker, while also doing some good in general<br>

                        Steve: To help more students have a clearer view of what does industry are expecting and what are recommended to do while you are still in school. </p>

                        <p>Lets do more than pipetting with these scrawny ass arms CHBE. Lets face it, most of us need to stay more active. I'm going to try convincing everyone to join my intramural teams through announcements in the computer lab, class announcements and one on one talks. I'm going to force students who typically don't play sports to come out and play. Also, we have some talented athletes in CHBE, some students are just not motivated enough to join a CHBE team, im going to try my best to make them come out.  </p>
